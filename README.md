# Google Maps Scraper
App Programming Course 
Made by Joel Keskinen, Panu Ter√§s and Jimi Hietakangas

This scraper parses Google Maps API to get the longitude and latitude from an inputted address. Along with the search radius and the business type, the user is given a list of the nearby businesses within the radius, along with the business address, distance, google rating and business status.

The scraper runs with Python3 and has been built using Flask and React.
